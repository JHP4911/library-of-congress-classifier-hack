Subclass
|| same indentation level as the previous subclass
|+ increase indentation level from previous subclass
|- decrease indentation level from previous subclass
# Notes:
# Number of pluses and minuses determine how far many subclasses away from the previous one it is
# There are no extra plus symbols beyond |+, as it would lose context (i.e. there's no category above it to reference to)
