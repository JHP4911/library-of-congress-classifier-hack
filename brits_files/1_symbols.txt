subclass split
| - increase indent
|+ - decrease indent (*creates alignment issues)
|| - same indentation level as last indentation
Number of pluses and minuses determine how far many subclasses away from the previous one it is

# We will continue to use the symbols above but...
# I sense it would have been more intuitive as:
|| same indentation level as the previous subclass
|+ increase indentation level from previous subclass
|- decrease indentation level from previous subclass
